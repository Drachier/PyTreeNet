Some ideas that make the code more readable/efficient
*Make a parentclass to TensorNode called Tensor, which differs by not having a
    distinction between children and parent legs
*Create a leg class which contains the attributes kind, index, from, to
    (This will require a lot of reworking on the remaining code.)
*Make term/multinode_operator a different subclass from tensor to represent
    operators applied to multiple nodes.
