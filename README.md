# PyTreeNet

[PyTreeNet](https://github.com/Drachier/PyTreeNet) is a python implemention of tree tensor networks with a focus on the simulation of quantum systems admitting a tree topology.

## Features
- General tree tensor networks, tree tensor networks states and tree tensor network operators
- Conversion of symbolic Hamiltonians into tree tensor networks
- TEBD and TDVP time-evolution algorithms
